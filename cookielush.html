			<div id="about-us"><p>The delicious smell of chocolate chip cookies is known to everyone across the nation. Americans thrive on deserts and chocolate chip cookies happen to be one of the many favorites. As there are many different types of deserts, there are also many different brands of chocolate chip cookies. Most Americans have their own preferences about which chocolate chip cookie they consider the best. I made it my goal to go out an find the best chocolate chip cookie by surveying people and testing three popular brands of cookies for flavor, chewiness, and appearance.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The three chocolate chip cookie brands tested were Chips Ahoy!, Keebler's Original Soft Batch, and Cub Foods brand. The three brands were rated on a scale from one to three (three being the best, one the worst) on their flavor, chewiness, and appearance. To score a three on flavor the cookie had to taste delicious and melt in your mouth like ice cream outside on a hot summer day. To score a three on chewiness, it had to be very soft like dough and take a long time to finish. Finally, to rate a three on appearance the cookie had to be very appealing to the taste tester and look delicious to eat. The brand of cookies that scored the highest in each category, I crowned the best chocolate chip cookie in America.</p>
